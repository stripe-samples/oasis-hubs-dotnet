# Oasis Hubs - Stripe Connect and Metered Billing Demo

![header](assets/header.png)

## Overview

The sample application contained in this repository aims to serve as a practical reference on how to
integrate Stripe Connect and metered billing into an ASP.NET Core application. It addresses core
concerns such as onboarding Express accounts, handling webhooks out of process, working with tiered
pricing,
subscriptions, invoices, test clocks and more.

The use case is centered around Oasis Hubs, a workspace booking platform focused on remote workers.
Customers are able to sign up for a monthly subscription that gives them access to book one of the
many unique
workspace listings. There are three subscription tiers available that offer different levels of
benefits and listing
access. The listings, also know as Hubs, are provided by hosts that get onboarded to Oasis and
associated with Stripe
Connect Express accounts.

## Requirements

* [.NET SDK 7.0+](https://get.dot.net)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
* [Stripe Account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
* [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

## [Container Dependencies](.compose/compose.yaml)

* [MS SQl Server](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-docker/tree/master) - Relational storage for
  user credentials, hubs, and bookings
* [Rabbitmq](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq) - Message broker for handling webhook
  events
* [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-stack/docker/) - Distributed cache

## Running the demo

[!CAUTION]
> This sample is meant to be run in TEST MODE in your Stripe account!

**Step 0**: <br /> 
Before running the demo, make sure you sign up for a Stripe
account, [activate it](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/onboarding),
and go through the [Connect setup](https://dashboard.stripe.com/connect/set-up) in the Stripe
Dashboard.

You will also need to activate the test link for the [Customer Portal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal).


**Step 1**: <br />
Retrieve the Stripe API keys from the Developers area of the Dashboard and store them in
the `Stripe` section
of the [appsettings.Development.json](./src/OasisHubs.Site/appsettings.Development.json)
configuration file.

**Step 2**: <br />
Start up the container dependencies using the [compose.yaml](.compose/compose.yaml)
file.

**Step 3**: <br />
Load test data with the `dotnet run data seed` command. This will populate the database tables
as well as the Stripe account with demo data.

**Step 4**: <br />
Run the application using the `dotnet run serve` command from the [OasisHubs.Site](src/OasisHubs.Site) directory.

**Step 5**: <br />
In a new terminal window, run the following command to forward Stripe events to the application
running locally.
```shell
stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/stripe/platform --forward-connect-to  http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/stripe/connect
```

**Step 6**: <br />
Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser.
